        I am an aspiring software engineer with a focus towards embedded applications.
        <br>I love to see my code in action on hardware.</br>
        Specific interests would be systems, automated systems, & robotics.

        <h3> About Me </h3>
        <p>
          I am currently a rising senior at the <a class="click-links" href="https://www.rochester.edu" target="_blank">University of Rochester</a>. 
          I am pursuing my undergraduate degree in electrical and computer engineering. I started exploring the world of embedded systems a year ago 
          and am fascinated by it. The intersection of hardware and software intrigues me. With a deep love of solving problems and building stuff, 
          I hope to contribute to the world in a meaningful way.

          <br><br>
          This summer (2021), I interned at <a class="click-links" href="https://www.extremenetworks.com/company/" target="_blank">Extreme Networks</a> 
          in San Jose, CA as a systems engineering intern. My work involved working with networking protocols, linux kernel, network security, and general 
          programming fundamentals. It was my first time working with a huge code base, and while it was certainly challenging, I really enjoyed the 
          experience!

      <div class="text-beside-picture" id="work-with">
        <h3 id="work-with-heading"> What I work with </h3>
        <p>
          Technologies that I work with on the regular include communication protocols, device drivers, system integration, operating 
          systems and more!
          <br><br>It involves concepts of both electrical/computer engineering and computer science fundamentals. That is why I enjoy the field
          of embedded software - it is an intersection of hardware and software.</br></br>
          Tech stack would generally include C, C++, Python, Matlab, Version Control Software (Git, Perforce), Make etc.

        <h3> What I enjoy outside of work </h3>
        <p>
          I love to explore new cities and landscapes, big fan of road trips, I love cooking and trying out new cuisines. I enjoy watching sports - 
          soccer fan here. I also like to read fiction. Since the start of quarantine, I have been playing chess and would love to play a game.
